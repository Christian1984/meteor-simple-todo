# What is this?

This todo-list project is me refreshing my Meteor skills by loosely following along Meteor's todo list tutorial...

# Notes

- Initialize a new Meteor project with `meteor create <name>`
- Start the server by cd'ing into the directory and call `meteor`
- Install React packages with `meteor npm install --save react react-dom`
- Remove Meteor's template engine with `meteor remove blaze-html-templates`
- Add the static html package with `meteor add static-html`
- Replace starter code so that all references to Meteor's template engine is gone
- Start coding :-)
